## Enterprise Brain Dump
Right now I'm running OMV as the main OS, and this server is acting as a NAS as well as hosting almost all my Docker conatiners.  
In the future, I would like this machine to just be a NAS, and move everything Docker to another machine running Proxmox.  
I also need to update OMV to the latest version as I am 2-3 versions behind currently.  
To do this, I need to make a backup of my entire configuration first, so I can easily set things back up and have minimal downtime.  
My main concern is getting this back up and running as a NAS as quickly as possible so Plex can access the files on the drives.  
I have most of the Docker containers converted over to Docker compose, and once that's all finished, I can start taking notes on my OMV config.
